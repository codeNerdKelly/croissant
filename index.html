        "Paris in the early morning has a cheerful, bustling aspect, a promise
        of delicious things to come, a positive smell of coffee and croissants,
        quite peculiar to itself. The people welcome a new day as if they were
        certain of liking it, the shopkeepers pull up their blinds serene in the
        expectation of good trade, the workers go happily to their work, the
        people who have sat up all night in night-clubs go happily to their
        rest, the orchestra of motor-car horns, of clanking trams, of whistling
        policemen tunes up for the daily symphony, and everywhere is joy."
